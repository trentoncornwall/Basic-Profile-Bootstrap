                Hello, I'm from Iowa. Which is very different from where I am now, Denver. I grew up a twin brother and
                many
                horses.
                Family and I would often take weekend vacations to a ranch were we road around on hourses, played in the
                woods.
                I eventually started bull riding, which lasted about 2 years.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                After graduating high-school in my small town, I went to a few smaller colleges before landing at the
                Univeristy of Iowa.
                Where I majored in Informatics. Upon graduating, I really wasn't interested in doing much of what I
                learned.
                But once class,
                did stand out to me. Which was a Computer Human Interactions. How people interacted with computers. We
                built
                a webpage,
                using BootStrap, MySQL, PHP. This was my absolute favorite class. I knew I wanted to do that for a
                living.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                So I started teaching myself as much as I could about web-development. I wanted to accerate the
                learning, so
                I invested in myself
                once again and started my journery and a Full Stack Web Development Boot Camp at the University of
                Denver.
                Where I'm excited to learn MongoDB and Node.JS. Which is what OpenTable, the company I work for uses.
