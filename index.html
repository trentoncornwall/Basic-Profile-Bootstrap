                        Hello, I'm from Iowa. Which is very different from where I am now, Denver. I grew up a twin brother and
                        many
                        horses.
                        Family and I would often take weekend vacations to a ranch were we road around on hourses, played in the
                        woods.
                        I eventually started bull riding, which lasted about 2 years.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        After graduating high-school in my small town, I went to a few smaller colleges before landing at the
                        Univeristy of Iowa.
                        Where I majored in Informatics. Upon graduating, I really wasn't interested in doing much of what I
                        learned.
                        But once class,
                        did stand out to me. Which was a Computer Human Interactions. How people interacted with computers. We
                        built
                        a webpage,
                        using BootStrap, MySQL, PHP. This was my absolute favorite class. I knew I wanted to do that for a
                        living.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        So I started teaching myself as much as I could about web-development. I wanted to accerate the
                        learning, so
                        I invested in myself
                        once again and started my journery and a Full Stack Web Development Boot Camp at the University of
                        Denver.
                        Where I'm excited to learn MongoDB and Node.JS. Which is what OpenTable, the company I work for uses.
